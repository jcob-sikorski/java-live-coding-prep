// parking lot is going to be a singleton

// parking lot has a composition of levels, each levek has a composition of parkig spots

// we're going to use an observer pattern so display boards (observers) can know about availability of a each parking spot (subject)

// we can use a strategy pattern for multiple types of ways multiple algorithms that find a parking lot
